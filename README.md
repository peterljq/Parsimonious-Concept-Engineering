# Parsimonious-Concept-Engineering
Parsimonious Concept Engineering (PaCE) uses sparse coding on a large-scale concept dictionary to effectively improve the trustworthiness of Large Language Models by precisely controlling and modifying their neural activations. The repository contains our concept representation dataset PaCE-1M mentioned in the paper.
